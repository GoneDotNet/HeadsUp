### Community Toolkit MVVM

The CommunityToolkit.Mvvm package (aka MVVM Toolkit, formerly named Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm) is a modern, fast, and modular MVVM library. It is part of the .NET Community Toolkit and is built around the following principles:

Platform and Runtime Independent - .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET 6 ðŸš€ (UI Framework Agnostic)
Simple to pick-up and use - No strict requirements on Application structure or coding-paradigms (outside of 'MVVM'ness), i.e., flexible usage.
Ã€ la carte - Freedom to choose which components to use.
Reference Implementation - Lean and performant, providing implementations for interfaces that are included in the Base Class Library, but lack concrete types to use them directly.
