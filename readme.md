# Heads Up Game Clone

Our first app is a clone of the popular Heads Up game, which is a fun and interactive game where players guess words based on clues given by their teammates. The app will feature:

## Features
* Takes a video recording of the players during the game
* Can flip the phone up to pass or down to indicate a correct guess
* Uses AI to generate answers for the game based on categories
* AI also returns phonetic answers, so values like Belle and Bell are treated the same
* Uses Text to Speech to read out the answers
* Saves game history and scores using SQLite database
* Simple and intuitive user interface
* Cross-platform support for iOS and Android using .NET MAUI

## TODO
* FEATURE: AI Phonetic Answers and structured data
* BUG: Prevent android back button on ready/game screens
* BUG: MediaElement will turn off audio player sounds
* SensorAnswerDetector
  * BUG: Its more of a flip left/right 
* Score Screen
  * BUG: Video not auto playing and no transparency through score

### Community Toolkit MVVM

The CommunityToolkit.Mvvm package (aka MVVM Toolkit, formerly named Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm) is a modern, fast, and modular MVVM library. It is part of the .NET Community Toolkit and is built around the following principles:

Platform and Runtime Independent - .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET 6 ðŸš€ (UI Framework Agnostic)
Simple to pick-up and use - No strict requirements on Application structure or coding-paradigms (outside of 'MVVM'ness), i.e., flexible usage.
Ã€ la carte - Freedom to choose which components to use.
Reference Implementation - Lean and performant, providing implementations for interfaces that are included in the Base Class Library, but lack concrete types to use them directly.
